# Co-Op Campaign Games — Ranked for Lovemonkey & Friend (Updated)

> **Context:** Both players on PC. Similar taste (RDR2, Witcher 3, GTA V, Cyberpunk 2077, KCD2). Looking for story-driven third-person co-op campaigns. Friend won't play souls-likes or BG3-style CRPGs.

**Story:** Bolivia is controlled by a drug cartel. You're a Ghost Recon team sent to dismantle it by taking down the cartel's leadership structure, region by region, until you reach the kingpin.

**Gameplay:** Open-world tactical third-person shooter. Approach missions any way you want — stealth, loud, vehicles, air support. Drone recon, weapon customization, massive map with tons of side content.

**Comparison:** Far Cry's chaos meets The Division's tactical shooting.

## **2. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2**

**Story:** You're Lieutenant Titus, a genetically-enhanced supersoldier defending humanity against the Tyranid alien swarm. Massive planetary invasion, millions of enemies, brothers-in-arms combat against impossible odds.

**Gameplay:** Third-person action shooter. Brutal melee combat (chainswords, power hammers) mixed with bolter gunplay. Executions restore armor. PvE Operations mode is 3-player co-op missions with their own storyline separate from the single-player campaign. Horde management — crowd control is key.

**Comparison:** Gears of War's weight and scale meets God of War's melee brutality, wrapped in Warhammer 40K grimdark aesthetic.

**Gameplay:** First-person parkour with expanded movement (paraglider, grappling hook). Melee combat with weapon crafting and modding. Day/night cycle is crucial — night is significantly more dangerous but offers better loot. Choices affect the world state. Full co-op campaign (4 players).

**Comparison:** Dying Light 1 but bigger, more RPG systems, player choice matters.

**Gameplay:** First-person parkour movement system — climb, vault, and traverse the city freely. Melee-focused combat with crafted weapons that degrade. Day/night cycle completely changes gameplay — night is genuinely terrifying with stronger, faster zombies. Co-op works seamlessly throughout the campaign.

**Comparison:** Mirror's Edge parkour meets Dead Island's melee combat and crafting.

**Gameplay:** Third-person souls-like shooter. Dodge-roll combat, stamina management, boss fights, but with guns and builds. Procedurally generated worlds mean different layouts/bosses each playthrough. Class system with unique abilities.

**Comparison:** Dark Souls meets Gears of War.

---

**🎮 Steam:** https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/

**🎥 Gameplay Clip:** *(Search YouTube: "Outriders co-op powers" for 10-20 sec clips)*

**Theme:** Sci-fi colonization gone wrong

**Story:** Humanity colonizes planet Enoch. Terraforming fails catastrophically, you're caught in an anomaly storm and gain superpowers. Decades later you wake up to find survivors at war, and you're the key to fixing everything.

**Gameplay:** Third-person cover shooter with class-based superpowers. Aggressive gameplay loop — healing comes from killing, not hiding. Build customization, loot-driven but not grindy. Full campaign is self-contained, no live service bullshit.

**Comparison:** Gears of War meets Destiny's powers, but entirely story-focused.

**Gameplay:** First-person shooter with regenerating shields and two-weapon limit. Vehicle combat (Warthogs, tanks, spacecraft), large-scale battles, iconic weapons (energy swords, plasma grenades). Six full campaigns with varying tones — Reach is dark/gritty, Halo 3 is epic scale, ODST is noir detective story.

**Comparison:** Classic arena FPS combat meets Starship Troopers scale and scope.

## **Notes:**

- **Wildlands** is closest to "GTA Online but fresh with actual story"
- **Space Marine 2** — keep pushing your friend on this one, it's excellent
- **Dying Light 2** — bigger scale than DL1, more RPG systems, player choices matter
- **Gears 5** — best third-person co-op campaign in recent years
- **Dying Light 1** — you already own it (25h estimate), worth trying first before DL2
- **Dying Light: The Beast** — standalone expansion releasing 2025, Kyle Crane returns
- **Halo MCC** — you own it on Xbox (2h 40m) and Steam (unplayed)
- **Remnant II** — souls-like but way more forgiving on easier difficulty
- **Outriders** — fast-paced action, less tactical than others

**Start with Ghost Recon Wildlands, Space Marine 2, or Dying Light 2** — all fit your criteria perfectly 🎮
